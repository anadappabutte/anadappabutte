        Microsoft Office, or simply Office, is a family of client software, server software, and 
        developed by Microsoft. It was first announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX 
        in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an office suite (bundled set of productivity
        applications), the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and
        Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer
        with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Visual Basic
        for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform 
        for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand. On July 
        10, 2012, Softpedia reported that Office was being used 
        by over a billion people worldwide.[11]
